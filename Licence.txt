The development of GMPHD-PMAU-SLAM utilizes code written by others, which are credited in the following.

The codes related to the PHD-SLAM 3.0 [1], including

Matlab m-files: simulation_setup.m, MonteCarloSimulations.m,  performance_summary.m, adaptiveDetectionProbability.m,
                initialize.m, f_func.m, h_func.m, predict.m, update.m, sample.m, resample.m, posterior_est.m,
                rbpf_phd.m,  plot_estimate.m



The codes related to the ranked assignment problem [2], including

Matlab m-files: assign2DByCol.m, BinaryHeap.m, kBest2DAssign.m, KeyVal.m, MurtyData.m

have been originally developed by David Crouse and can be found from:

https://github.com/USNavalResearchLaboratory/TrackerComponentLibrary

To reduce computational complexity, the original code has been modified to terminate hypothesis generation 
whenever the cost of the most likely hypotheses is below some fixed percentage of the cost of the next hypotheses
as described in [3].



The codes related to the GOSPA metric [4], including auctionAlgorithm.m and GOSPA.m have been 
written by Abu Sajana Rahmathullah and can be found from: https://github.com/abusajana/GOSPA



The function resample.m is originally developed by Aki Vehtari and it has been modified for PHD-SLAM 3.0.
The original code can be found from: https://github.com/EEA-sensors/ekfukf/blob/develop/resampstr.m



The rest of the algorithms have been developed and tested by:
